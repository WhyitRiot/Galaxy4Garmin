# Galaxy4Garmin

I love my Galaxy Watch4 Classic. The rotating bezel. The crisp display. 
But probably most of all is the watch face I had.
Just a simple watch face that displays the local time & date, and then a time zone of your choice.

It's nothing too special or complicated, but as I work in various countries and time zones, it helped me keep track of my loved ones back home.

This is a basic recreation of that watch face for my Garmin Descent Mk2s.
